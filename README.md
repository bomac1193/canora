# Canora

**Remember everything. Choose the few.**

## Diagnosis

We live in an age of infinite AI-generated content. Anyone can produce endless creative output, but this abundance creates a crisis: how do we distinguish signal from noise? How do we preserve creative lineage without drowning in an undifferentiated archive?

The core problem Canora addresses is **curation at scale**. Without rigorous, human-driven selection, archives become landfills. Works of genuine cultural significance get buried alongside ephemeral content. The full genealogy of creative ideas—forks, remixes, derivations—risks being lost or ignored.

## Guiding Policy

Canora implements a **three-tiered curation pipeline with irreversible escalation**:

| Tier | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **JAM** | Raw submissions. Anyone can contribute. Impermanent by default. |
| 2 | **PLATE** | Curator-reviewed works deemed notable. Reversible promotion. |
| 3 | **CANON** | Permanently preserved. Irreversible. A cultural commitment. |

The policy is simple: **most things should disappear; a few things should endure.** Promotion to Canon requires a signed justification from a curator and cannot be undone. This forces deliberate, accountable decision-making about what deserves permanence.

## Strategy

### 1. Full Lineage Preservation

Every creative work maintains its genealogy. Forks, merges, and derivations are tracked in a directed graph, allowing anyone to trace the evolution of ideas. Attribution is explicit—contributors are credited by role (vocal, beat, lyric, AI assist, etc.), and AI involvement must be disclosed.

### 2. Curator Accountability

Only designated curators can promote works through the pipeline. Each promotion requires written justification (minimum 10 characters) that becomes a permanent, immutable record. Canon promotion triggers a two-step confirmation with explicit warnings. Curators are permanently identified with their decisions—there is no anonymous gatekeeping.

This combination ensures the archive grows responsibly: everything is remembered, but only the few are chosen.
